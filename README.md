# xenon-modpack

Xenon ModPack is a simple to use base for the creation of modpacks.

## Features
* Mod System
* (Key) Binding system
* Property System
* EventBus
* Rendering utilities
* Tab UI

## Tab UI
Xenon uses a different approach to managing mods. We use a UI that is manageable through the keyboard rather than UI that is mouse driven.

## TODO
* Add mouse button capability to the binding system
* Add optional mouse driven user interface to manage mods
* Add command system (probably just brigadier)
